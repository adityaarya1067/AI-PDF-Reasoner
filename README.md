AI PDF Reasoner is an intelligent document analysis tool that enables users to interact with PDF documents through natural language queries. Built with Python and powered by advanced language models (Groq's deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b), the application processes uploaded PDFs using PDFPlumber for text extraction, creates embeddings using Ollama (deepseek-r1:7b), and stores them in a FAISS vector database for efficient similarity search. The system leverages LangChain for document processing and FAISS for vector similarity search, making it a robust solution for document analysis and question-answering tasks. Users can input PDFs and queries programmatically, receiving context-aware responses based on the document's content.
